### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Colin, a blogger and tinkerer â€“Â not a developer.

Having spent a number of years on WordPress, writing some add-ins and designing a custom overly to negate the need for wp-admin, I decided to create my own CMS and [(b)log-In](https://github.com/colin-walker/blog-In) was born.

I have proposed the ['now' namespace](https://github.com/colin-walker/Now-Namespace) for RSS to share /now page style updates as part of your normal RSS feed. Comments, suggestions and discussion welcome.

I'm also currently working on another simple blogging platform called '[hyblog](https://github.com/colin-walker/hyblog)' (hybrid blog) that uses dynamic pages pulling post info from static .md files.
